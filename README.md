# Exploratory Data Analysis on "Indian Food Dataset"
This analysis delves into the Indian food dataset, focusing on systematic data assessment, cleansing, and feature engineering to enrich dataset usability and insights. It includes as key features:

    1. Data Structure Evaluation: Analyzing dataset composition, including data types, column details, and 
                                  unique value counts, to understand its foundational structure.

    2. Missing Value Handling: Precisely identifying and address null values within key columns, 
                               employing appropriate imputation strategies to maintain data integrity.

    3. Feature Engineering: Introducing new attributes to enhance analytical depth, such as total_time (summing 
                            preparation and cooking times) and num_ingredients (counting ingredients for each dish).

Execution Details:

    -Data Inspection: Assessing column types, unique names, and generatig statistical summaries for a concise 
                      overview.

    -Imputation of Missing Data: Replacing absent region values with a placeholder, and removing rows with 
                                 critical missing entries for consistency.

    -Numerical and Categorical Breakdown: Segmenting numeric and categorical data, facilitating tailored 
                                          analyses on dataset structure.

    -Data Export: Finalizing and exporting the refined dataset with added features to support subsequent analysis.
